There are many projects in this profile. The following is a list of the top projects that are my main priority at this time :
### 1. IHRD-R

This is a robot designed to perform time-optimized deliveries to hotel rooms. The core of the project is finished. There is some further development planned like multi-agent delivery, a centralized system for the dynamic deployment of multiple robots.

### 2. Reasoning-based architecture for Ad-hoc agent modeling

This is my MSc. Robotics dissertation project at the University of Birmingham. The project contributes to the vision of Cognitive Architectures to develop human-like Intelligence by mimicking the human cognitive system. 
### 3. BEAR Hackathon files.

These are the challenges my team completed during the bear hackathon challenge held at the University of Birmingham.
