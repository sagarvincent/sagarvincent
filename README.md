There are many projects in this profile. The following is a list of top five projects that are my main priority at this time :
### 1. IHRD-R

This is robot designed to perform time optimised deliveries to hotel room. The core of the project is finished. There are some further development planned like multi agent delivery, centralised system for dynamic deployment of multiple robots.

### 2. Reasoning based architecture for Ad-hoc agent modelling

This is my MSc. Robotics dissertation project at the University of Birmingham. The project contributes to the vision of Cognitive Architectures to develop human like Intelligence by mimicking the human cognitive system.
