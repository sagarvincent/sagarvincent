There are many projects in this profile. The following is a list of the top projects that are my main priority at this time :

### 1. CV Analyser

A website that evaluates your cv against each Job description that you apply for. This helps to understand how optimised you CV is, and is a valuable tool for both recruiters and candiadates.

### 2. CookMeUp

An AI-powered program that outputs cooking instructions and directions for queries that are issued by the user.

### 3. IHRD-R

This is a robot designed to perform time-optimized deliveries to hotel rooms. The core of the project is finished. There is some further development planned like multi-agent delivery, a centralized system for the dynamic deployment of multiple robots.
