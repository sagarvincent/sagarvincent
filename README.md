There are many projects in this profile. The following is a list of the top projects that are my main priority at this time :
### 1. CookMeUp

An AI-powered program that outputs cooking instructions and directions for queries that are issued by the user.

### 2. IHRD-R

This is a robot designed to perform time-optimized deliveries to hotel rooms. The core of the project is finished. There is some further development planned like multi-agent delivery, a centralized system for the dynamic deployment of multiple robots.

### 3. Reasoning-based architecture for Ad-hoc agent modeling

This is my MSc.Robotics dissertation project at the University of Birmingham. The project contributes to the vision of Cognitive Architectures to develop human-like Intelligence by mimicking the human cognitive system.
